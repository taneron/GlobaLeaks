[!] When reading this documentation, please note that optional features are not enabled by default and may be available on the platform only if configured by the administrator.

Access the list of the existing reports
---------------------------------------
You can access the lists of the existing reports via the link “Reports” on the sidebar of your dashboard's homepage. Reports with the most recent activities (new or updated) come first.

.. image:: ../../images/recipient/reports.png
   :align: center

From the list you can view for each report:

- whether it is marked as important;
- whether it is set with a reminder;
- whether the reporting person has read the last update;
- the number of comments;
- the number of attachments;
- whether the reporting person has provided their identity through the template identity question (optional, see: Admin > Template identity question);
- the number of recipients.

Order and filter reports
------------------------
You can order the list of reports by channels (if more than one), label (if any), status, report date, last update and expiration date, by clicking on the respective title at the top of the list.

You can filter reports by status.

Select reports
--------------
You can select one or more reports by clicking on the box on the left of the reports' list or you can select all reports by clicking on the [:fa:`square`] icon on the top of the list.

Enter a report
--------------
As recipient, in many circumstances you might need to enter a report received through other channels, for example while assisting by phone or in an in-person meeting. To enter a report received through other channels click on the [:fa:`file-pen`] icon on the top of the list. Then you are offered the same procedure of the reporting person and are asked to fill the existing questionnaire.

At the end of the procedure, the system issues a one-time access code that should be communicated to the reporting person to allow them to access the contents of the report entered by the recipient. The code can be used only once, upon the reporting person’s first access to prevent access by other parties who might intercept it.

Once this initial access has been made, the system generates a new definitive access code that will allow the reporting person to access the report again and continue to monitor its progress. Please note that this feature can be helpful in case the reporting person used a channel other than the platform but is interested in and agrees to rely on the platform later in order to verify the transcription of the report, attach additional evidence, or continue communication with the recipient through this tool.

Refresh the list of reports
---------------------------
You can refresh the list of reports by clicking on the [:fa:`arrows-rotate`] icon on the top of the list.

Search a report
---------------
You can search a report by keywords using the search bar on the top of the list. The system will look for your keywords in the content of reports and filter the list by found results.

Export the list of reports
--------------------------
You can export the list of reports as .CSV file by clicking on the “Export” link at the right bottom of the list.

Access a report
---------------
When a reporting person submits a report, or updates an existing one, you will receive an email notification. You can access the report in two ways:

- by clicking the link provided in the email. Then you will be prompted to log into the system using your credentials (see: Login) and you will be directed to the specific report page;
- by accessing the list of reports via the link ``Reports``` on the sidebar of your dashboard's homepage and clicking on the new or updated report. New or updated reports are in bold.
