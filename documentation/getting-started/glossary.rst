   Whistleblower
       A whistleblower is a specific category of reporting person, an individual either internal or external to an organisation who, in the public interest, discloses wrongdoing, misconduct, negligence, or abuse occurring within a public body, company, or another type of legal entity. Such disclosures are made to entities or authorities capable of taking action, or to the public.
       Internationally, whistleblowers are recognised as key actors in promoting transparency and integrity. In many countries, they may be entitled to legal protection under the laws applicable in their jurisdiction. Regardless of the legal framework, whistleblowers often operate under significant personal risk and pressure.
