Getting informed
================

What you need to know before reporting
--------------------------------------

To report safely and effectively, we recommend that you understand the following key information before taking any action:

1. **Are you entitled to submit a report?**

   It is crucial to verify whether you are legally or substantially allowed to report to the selected organisation through the chosen platform or channel, and whether you are eligible for any legal protection.

   While you can still choose to report regardless of entitlement, being informed about the potential risks, especially if you are not covered by protection laws, is essential.

2. **Does your report fall within the scope of the selected channel?**

   Make sure you are using the right reporting channel for the issue at hand. If your report falls outside the channel’s scope, it might be ignored or forwarded to another party, which could compromise confidentiality.

3. **Who will receive your report?**

   Understand who the designated recipient is, whether it's a trusted person, department, or an independent body.  
   If you suspect the recipient is not independent or trustworthy, consider using alternative reporting channels.

4. **How will your report be handled?**

   Find out how the organization processes reports:

   - What investigative actions can be taken?
   - What timelines are followed?
   - When and how will you be updated?
   - What outcomes can you expect?

   Knowing this will help manage expectations and ensure transparency.

5. **How will your data be used?**

   Make sure your personal data and the contents of your report are handled securely and confidentially, in line with national and international privacy laws.

   Check whether your data might be shared with other authorities, with or without your consent, and under what conditions, and how long it will be retained.

   An organization should always provide a privacy or data protection policy.  
   If such information is missing, proceed with caution.

6. **What alternative reporting options are available in your country?**

   If you doubt the independence or trustworthiness of the organization you plan to report to, explore other available options, such as national authorities, sectoral regulators, or public interest disclosure platforms.

   Carefully assess all possible avenues before deciding how and where to report.

Where to find this information
------------------------------

You can usually find this information on the organization’s website, especially on the page hosting the reporting platform.

Information might also be available within the platform itself, particularly at the beginning of the reporting process in the terms and conditions, or in linked policies related to the reporting process.

Seek support from experienced Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are uncertain or have questions about the process, consider reaching out to national or international CSOs with expertise in whistleblowing and reporting before taking any action.

You don’t have to go through this alone; these organizations can provide guidance and support, which can be vital in protecting yourself and strengthening your case.
