"Whistleblowers play a crucial role in safeguarding accountability, "
"transparency, and integrity within organizations and society. Often "
"operating from vulnerable positions and facing professional, legal, or "
"personal risks, they may be entitled to protection under the laws of "
"their country. To empower their actions and ensure effectiveness, digital"
" whistleblowing systems should be designed according to strong principles"
" of protection, privacy, accessibility, scalability, and sustainability."

"To put these principles into practice, such systems should aim to comply "
"with international regulations [1]_ and recognized industry standards "
