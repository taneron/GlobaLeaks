Requirements
============
Ensure you understand and meet each of the following technical requirements.

Hardware requirements
---------------------
**Requirements**:

- CPU: Dual-core 2.0GHz (64-bit)
- RAM: 1GB
- Storage: 20GB
- I/O: 10Mbit/s (shared)

Please note that GlobaLeaks is designed to run on servers with specifications smaller than those listed above.

The storage size should be determined based on your data retention policies and the expected use of the platform.

Software requirements
---------------------
GlobaLeaks is designed to run on GNU/Linux and is developed and tested specifically for Debian-based systems.

The currently recommended distributions are: Debian 13 (Trixie) and Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)

The software lifecycle of the platform includes full support for all Debian and Ubuntu LTS versions starting from `Debian 10 <https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/>`_ and `Ubuntu 20.04 <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`_.

Support is guaranteed on these platforms according to the official long-term support timelines:

- `Debian Release End of Life Timeline <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>`_
- `Ubuntu Release End of Life Timeline <https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life>`_

Currently, we do not plan to support additional distributions, as GlobaLeaks adheres to the Unix philosophy of making each program excel in a specific area. By focusing our efforts on mastering one domain, we aim to serve our community most effectively. If you are interested in helping us extend support to additional distributions, please get in touch.
